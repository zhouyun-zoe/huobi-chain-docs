## Introduction

Huobi Chain is a high-performance public chain jointly developed by [Huobi](https://www.huobigroup.com/)and [Nervos Foundation](https://www.nervos.org/). It is based on deep customization of open source components such as [Muta](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/muta),[CKB-VM](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-vm),[Overlord](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/overlord),[Nervos-p2p](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/p2p), and is extended and optimized for financial application scenarios.

The main technical features of the Huobi chain are: use adaptive pipeline consensus algorithm to improve transaction throughput; use aggregate signature technology to reduce the delay of consensus process; use account-based CKB-VM to implement compiler and hardware-friendly high-performance Virtual machine that support smart contract; have built-in first-class asset type, which means built-in system contract can be used to manager user assets, which greatly improving security, versatility, and complexity; support native cross-chain protocol which means Huobi public chain, Nervos CKB and other chain developed basing on Huobi chain or  Muta can be directly cross-chain communicated with each other; support for highly flexible virtual machine and high-performance native contracts to accommodate different business scenarios.

In terms of optimization for financial applications, Huobi chain plans to support transaction deterministic receipts, single account transaction concurrent processing, arbitrary asset payment for transaction fees, third party payment fees, financial industry DSL execution environment, etc. Most of the characteristics of Huobi chain. Besides, the Huobi Chain will provide pluggable regulatory components which can selectively supervise contract deployment, asset holding and transfer, KYC and AML depending on the application scenario.

## Get Started

- If you want to build your own blockchain based on Huobi Chain technology, you can refer to Quick [Start](./docs/getting_started.md).
- If you want to know the architecture design of the Huobi Chain, you can refer to the [architecture design and module design](./arch.md).
- If you want to develop decentralized applications on Huobi Chain, you can refer to the [contract development tutorial](./contract_demo.md).

## Key Features

> Huobi chain is currently in the early stages of development, so the technical details, design documentation, and implementation code are subject to frequent changes.

### Parallel Execution Consensus

The Huobi chain adopts the [Overlord][overlord] consensus algorithm, which is designed to be a BFT consensus algorithm capable of supporting hundreds of consensus nodes, satisfying thousands of transactions per second with trading delays of no more than a few seconds. The core idea of ​​Overlord is to decouple transaction sequencing and state consensus, so that the consensus module and the execution module can be executed in parallel, which greatly improves the transaction throughput of the entire chain. Moreover, the consensus mechanism of Overload ensures that the blocks on the chain are determined and cannot be rolled back, which is more suitable for financial scenarios.

### Built-in Interoperation Capability

The UDT instantiated with FCA has cross-chain function natively, and the cross-chain protocol can be used to implement the decentralized cross-chain between the Huobi public chain and its side chain, as well as between the Huobi Chain and the Nervos CKB.

We pass the cross-chain proof in a decentralized relay. The relayer can be a sidechain validator or other third-party users. Direct cross-chain functionality can be achieved between the side chains without relying on the Huobi Chain or the Nervos CKB. 

### Flexible and customizable service

Service is an abstraction layer used in the Muta framework for extension. Users can define chain management, add VMs, or implement a dapp based on the services. Huobi Chain testnet currently based on the Muta framework have four built-in services: asset service, RISC-V service, metadata service, and node manager service. In the future, Huobi Chain will add more functional features through services to meet application requirements and regulatory requirements. And the side chain can also reuse these services when realizing high-performance specific business.

### Application development

Users can issue their own tokens or develop decentralized applications through contracts on the current testnet. Contracts can be written in C language, and would be compiled into RISC-V code and dynamically deployed on the chain. Huobi Chain will support more contract programming languages ​​in the future to further improve the developer experience.
